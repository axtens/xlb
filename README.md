Library files written in Fitted Software Tools Modula-2

The following MOD and DEF files are library files used by my other FST Modula-2 projects.

Building and/conversion to other Modula-2 compilers is left as an exercise for the reader and/or author.

Other Modula-2 compilers: [M2F](http://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/Glamorgan/gaius/web/m2fabout.html), [GNU Modula-2](https://www.nongnu.org/gm2/download.html), [XDS](https://github.com/excelsior-oss/xds) and [ADW](https://www.modula2.org/adwm2/).

Other good Modula-2 information can be found at [Peter Moylan](http://www.pmoylan.org/pages/m2/Modula2.html)'s site.
